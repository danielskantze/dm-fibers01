This is a great starting point. Your `ParameterService` is an excellent foundation. It's already a central, observable registry that handles the "single source of truth" for your parameters, which is a notoriously difficult part of this problem.

What you've built perfectly implements the concept of a **Base Value** store. Your UI sliders can read/write to this service, and your `load`/`toPreset` methods are the foundation of your **Section** layer (as a "snapshot" system).

To achieve your artistic goals, the next conceptual step is to evolve this service from a simple _value store_ into a **modulation management system**.

Here is the conceptual plan for how to model this, building on your existing service.

---

### 1\. The Core Concept: The `ManagedParameter`

Right now, your service stores `ParameterData`, and the `value` is just one field inside it. The core change is to introduce a new "live" object for each parameter that _manages_ the modulation.

Let's call this new concept a `ManagedParameter`.

Your `ParameterService` will no longer store static `ParameterData`. Instead, it will **create and hold a map** of these `ManagedParameter` objects (e.g., `registry: Record<string, ManagedParameter>`).

This new `ManagedParameter` class will be responsible for:

1.  Holding the **`baseValue`** (this is the value your UI sliders edit and presets load).
2.  Holding a **`modifiers: IModifier[]`** list (the "modifier stack").
3.  Calculating and caching the **`finalValue`**.
4.  Notifying subscribers **only when the `finalValue` changes**.

### 2\. The Modifier Interface: `IModifier`

This is the key to your **Perceptual** layer. A modifier is a pluggable piece of logic that can alter a parameter's value.

You'll want to define a common interface for them. Conceptually, a modifier needs:

- **An `id`:** To manage it in the stack (e.g., "lfo1", "kick_drum_reactive").
- **A `type`:** e.g., `LFO`, `AudioFeature`, `Envelope`, `MIDI`.
- **Configuration:** e.g., `{ frequency: 10, amplitude: 0.5 }` or `{ feature: "rms", scale: 2.0 }`.
- **A `compute()` method:** This is where it gets its current value (e.g., the LFO calculates `Math.sin(...)`, the audio modifier gets the latest `rms` value).
- **A `blendMode`:** How does it combine? (`ADD`, `MULTIPLY`, `OVERWRITE`).

Your audio analysis service will feed data into `AudioFeature` modifiers. Your MIDI service will feed data into `MIDI` modifiers. An animation loop will update `LFO` modifiers.

### 3\. Updating the `ParameterService` Logic

Your service's job now becomes managing the _lifecycle_ of these `ManagedParameter` objects and their modifiers.

- **`ParameterService.register`:**
  - Creates a new `ManagedParameter` instance.
  - Stores the `baseValue` from the config.
  - Stores this instance in its registry.

- **`ParameterService.setValue` (UI Interaction):**
  - This method now calls `managedParam.setBaseValue(value)`.
  - The `ManagedParameter` then re-computes its `finalValue` and notifies _its_ subscribers (the renderer).

- **`ParameterService.getValue` (UI Interaction):**
  - This method now returns `managedParam.getBaseValue()`. This is crucial: **your UI should be bound to the `baseValue`, not the `finalValue`**. This allows you to see the baseline while the `finalValue` is oscillating like crazy.

- **`ParameterService.subscribe` (Renderer Interaction):**
  - The WebGL renderer (your uniform update logic) no longer subscribes to the _service_.
  - It asks the service for the parameter, e.g., `service.getManagedParameter("particles", "speed")`.
  - It then calls `managedParam.subscribe(finalValue => ...)`.
  - This is a critical distinction:
    - **UI** subscribes to `baseValue` changes.
    - **Renderer** subscribes to `finalValue` changes.

### 4\. Evolving "Sections" and "Presets"

This is where your **Section** layer becomes powerful. Your `ParameterPreset` type needs to be expanded.

A preset is no longer just a snapshot of `ParameterValues`. A preset is a snapshot of the **entire configuration**:

```typescript
export type ParameterPreset = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ... other metadata

  // All the base values for this scene
  baseValues: Record<string, Record<string, UniformValue>>;

  // All the active modifiers for this scene
  modifiers: Record<string, Record<string, IModifier[]>>;

  // (Optional) Post-processing / Mood settings
  postProcessing: { ... };
};
```

Now, your `ParameterService.load(preset)` method becomes much more powerful:

1.  It iterates over all `ManagedParameter` objects.
2.  It calls `param.setBaseValue(preset.baseValues[...])` for each.
3.  It calls `param.clearModifiers()` on all parameters.
4.  It _re-instantiates_ the modifiers from the `preset.modifiers` config and adds them to the correct parameters using `param.addModifier(...)`.

**Transitions:** To handle "slow and gradual" transitions, your `load` method would take a `transitionTime: number`. It wouldn't _set_ the `baseValue` immediately. Instead, it would start an internal "tween" (e.g., using a library like `gsap` or a simple `lerp`) that animates the `baseValue` of every parameter from its old value to the new one over the specified time.

### 5\. Modeling the "Mood" Layer

With this new model, the **Mood** layer can be implemented in two simple ways:

1.  **As part of the Section Preset:** The "mood" is just a set of `baseValues` (e.g., color palettes, blur amounts) and `modifiers` (e.g., a slow LFO on camera focus) that are loaded as part of the "Intro" or "Chorus" preset. This is the simplest way.
2.  **As a Global Modifier Set:** You could have a separate "Mood" preset that is _layered on top_. When you load a "Sad" mood, the service adds a set of global modifiers (e.g., a `ColorGradeModifier` on the final render, a `TimeScaleModifier` that scales all `LFO` frequencies by 0.5). This is more complex but more modular.

I recommend starting with **Option 1** and embedding the mood within your Section presets.

### Summary of Your New Architecture

1.  **`ParameterService` (Your current code, evolved):**
    - The "owner" and "factory" of parameters.
    - Manages loading/saving of **full presets** (Base Values + Modifier configs).
    - Handles **transitions** (tweening) between presets.

2.  **`ManagedParameter` (New Class):**
    - The "live" parameter.
    - Knows its `baseValue` (from UI/Preset).
    - Knows its `modifiers: IModifier[]`.
    - Knows its `finalValue`.
    - Notifies UI of `baseValue` changes.
    - Notifies Renderer of `finalValue` changes.

3.  **`IModifier` (New Interface):**
    - The "pluggable logic."
    - `LFO`, `AudioFeature`, `MIDI`, `Envelope`, etc.
    - Is fed data from other services (Audio, MIDI, Animation).
    - The `ManagedParameter` reads from it to compute the `finalValue`.

This model directly maps to your artistic goals, solves the separation of concerns, and builds directly on the solid foundation you've already coded.
